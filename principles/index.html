      <p class="intro-p">
        This page is not an implementation guide for the idk-lamp.<br>
        When designing the idk-lamp, the core question is:<br>
        <strong>How do we determine where to stop the decision?</strong><br>
        This page offers a perspective for that inquiry.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="principles-grid">

      <div class="column">
        <div class="symbol sym-boundary"></div>
        <span class="col-label">01. Boundary</span>

        <p>A boundary is not a line<br>dividing "can" from "cannot".</p>
        <p>
          It is the position that separates<br>
          <strong>who accepts the responsibility for the result.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          AI can execute many judgments.<br>
          However, it cannot become the subject<br>
          that bears the responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          As judgment proceeds,<br>
          responsibility moves somewhere.<br>
          The boundary handled by the idk-lamp is<br>
          <strong>the point where the destination of responsibility shifts.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <div class="symbol sym-hold"></div>
        <span class="col-label">02. Decision Hold</span>

        <p>Holding judgment is not<br>abandoning it.</p>
        <p>
          It is<br>
          <strong>explicitly stating the state of not being able to accept responsibility yet.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The judgment remains undetermined.<br>
          The process has not failed.<br>
          Nor does it proceed automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decision Hold is not<br>
          an action of "stopping",<br>
          but a <strong>design of a state.</strong><br>
          When this state is established,<br>
          the idk-lamp lights up.
        </p>

      <div class="column">
        <div class="symbol sym-gate"></div>
        <span class="col-label">03. Gate</span>

        <p>
          The gate is not<br>
          a device to stop judgment.<br>
          Nor is it a checklist<br>
          to evaluate if passing conditions are met.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gate verifies only one thing:<br>
          <strong>How far is it safe for this judgment to proceed?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Passing through does not mean<br>
          automatic execution.<br>
          The failure to pass is, in itself,<br>
          critical information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gate does not<br>
          evaluate the correctness of the judgment.<br>
          It is placed as a mechanism<br>
          <strong>to ensure the judgment is entrusted to the right entity.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="outro-block">
      <p class="intro-p">
        The idk-lamp is not<br>
        a design for stopping decisions.<br>
        It is a design for<br>
        <strong>returning decisions to the place where they can be properly undertaken.</strong>
      </p>

        This page is not an implementation specification. It provides no manuals or flowcharts.<br>
        It leaves room for the reader to think within their own context.<br>
        If necessary, this design may be extended under a different name or form.<br>
        For now, this is sufficient.
